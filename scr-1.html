                <span class="first-word">On June 16</span>, KQ Entertainment released the MV for ATEEZ's BOUNCY (K-HOT CHILLI PEPPERS) from 'THE WORLD EP.2: OUTLAW'.
                Following on from the previous album, this new album features a subsequent episode that is more exciting and energetic.
                The unique promotion that made use of the title song, BOUNCY, and the subtitle K-HOT CHILLI PEPPERS both revolve around the Cheongyang pepper material.
                It conveys the message that the world dances to an unconventional rhythm and that the world can change if you want it to.
                <br><br>
                This album also features This World, which continues the series' theme, Dune, which asks what one should live for, and DJANGO, which makes us think of a desert wind and a western movie, as well as inner confusion.
                Six songs are included, including Wake Up, which soothes anxiety, and Outlaw, which tells the story of confronting the wrong world head-on.
                Their first single album SPIN OFF: FROM THE WITNESS, which came out in December of last year, has been set a record by ATEEZ as it tops three times on the Billboard main chart, Billboard 200, and is getting ready for the next step—which stoked anticipation.
                As a consequence of this, the brand-new album THE WORLD EP.2: OUTLAW, which came out half a year later.

                    <span class="first-word">The Repsol Honda</span> fell while on a fast lap and his bike slid into Zarco, who was exiting the pits, and he was violently knocked over.
                    The Pramac Racing rider fortunately rose to his feet and walked away, seemingly without major harm, moments later.
                    It was a horrible-looking collision which Zarco emerged from. He banged his head on the ground as he fell.
                    The session was red flagged with three minutes and seven seconds remaining.
                    Zarco, whose bike split into two piece due to the enormity of the smash, saw his session ended. Although Marquez did briefly go back out.
                    Fellow Honda rider Takaaki Nakagami earlier suffered a big crash at the Sachsenring.
                    Joan Mir and Alex Rins are absent this weekend after injuries caused by crashes last weekend.
                    Marquez has failed to finish the past four grands prix that he has started, and has explained how the limitations of his Honda results in him taking extra risk.

                <p>
                    <span class="first-word">Jujutsu Kaisen</span> is one of the most anticipated anime around, so when fans learned they'd get treated to another stellar season by MAPPA,
                    they quickly wondered how much there would be.
                    The advantage of it being a Shonen manga adaptation is that there will be lots to chew on, and soon.
                    But with this in mind, it's good to know the anticipated Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 release date schedule for 2023!
                    JJK Season 2 covers Gojo's past when he was a second-year student at Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School in 2006.
                    The story will shift toward the present with the Shibuya Incident Arc, and it is commonly referred to by the fans as possibly the best in the series.
                    The fact that MAPPA is doing it, fresh off releasing a stellar second season of Vinland Saga, is just an added blessing.
                    Or since we're talking about Jujutsu Kaisen here, perhaps curse would be the more appropriate wording. We're in for a real treat soon!
